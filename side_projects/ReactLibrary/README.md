## React Library of Reusable Components
As required by scrimba, I began my very own library of reusable components. This library is built using React and is intended to be used in any React project. I've placed it in an org I am a member of so that others can use it as well! [link to the repo](https://github.com/Visions-to-Visuals/react-component-library/blob/main/README.md)

## What I did 
So far, I've created a "toast" component that can be used to display messages to the user.
