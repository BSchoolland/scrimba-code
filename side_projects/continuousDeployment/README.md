## Side project: Conitnuous Deployment Pipeline
I was inspired to create a continuous deployment pipeline after going through "React Router, Initial Deploy to Netlify"
This may have been slightly off topic but I belive the skills learned during my hour long sidetrack will be valuable.  

## What I did
I implemented continuous deployment on a [previous project of mine](https://github.com/BSchoolland/Vehicle-Building-Game) using github actions.
